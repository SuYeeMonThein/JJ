# Feature Specification: User Authentication & Product Management Webapp

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-webapp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an webapp with user authentication (sign‚Äëup, login, logout) and basic CRUD for a Product resource with simple UI"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to manage products in a web application with secure access control. They need to create an account, sign in securely, and then create, view, edit, and delete products through an intuitive web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the webapp, **When** they click "Sign Up" and provide valid credentials, **Then** they can create an account and are automatically logged in
2. **Given** an existing user with valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they can access the product management interface
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they create a new product with required information, **Then** the product is saved and displayed in their product list
4. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their products, **When** they edit a product and save changes, **Then** the updated information is persisted and displayed
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they delete a product, **Then** the product is removed from their list permanently
6. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they log out, **Then** they are redirected to the login page and cannot access protected content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access product pages without being logged in?
- How does the system handle duplicate email addresses during sign-up?
- What occurs when a user submits invalid or incomplete product information?
- How does the system respond to failed login attempts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow new users to create accounts with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email addresses during sign-up to ensure proper format
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate users with email/password combination for login
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to securely log out and end their session
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict access to product management features to authenticated users only
- **FR-006**: Authenticated users MUST be able to create new products with name, description, and price
- **FR-007**: Authenticated users MUST be able to view a list of all their products
- **FR-008**: Authenticated users MUST be able to edit existing product information
- **FR-009**: Authenticated users MUST be able to delete products from their collection
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear feedback for all user actions (success/error messages)
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to other users' products
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain user sessions securely until explicit logout
- **FR-013**: UI MUST be intuitive and follow clean design principles as per constitution
- **FR-014**: System MUST respond within performance targets (<2s page load, <200ms API responses)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a registered user with email, password, and personal product collection
- **Product**: Represents an item managed by users with name, description, price, and ownership relationship to specific user
