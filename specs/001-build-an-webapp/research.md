# Research: Client-Side Authentication & Storage

## Browser Storage Options

### Decision: IndexedDB for Product Data, localStorage for Session
**Rationale**: IndexedDB provides structured storage for complex product objects with better performance and larger capacity than localStorage. localStorage is simpler for session tokens and user preferences.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **localStorage only**: Limited to 5-10MB, string-only storage
- **sessionStorage**: Lost on tab close, not suitable for persistent data
- **WebSQL**: Deprecated by browsers

## Client-Side Password Security

### Decision: Web Crypto API with PBKDF2
**Rationale**: Built-in browser API provides cryptographically secure password hashing without external dependencies. PBKDF2 with salt prevents rainbow table attacks.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **bcrypt.js**: External dependency, larger bundle size
- **Plain hashing**: Insecure against attacks
- **Custom crypto**: Risk of implementation flaws

## Session Management

### Decision: JWT-like tokens in localStorage with expiration
**Rationale**: Simple to implement, automatic expiration, can store user metadata. Client-side only so no server verification needed.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Cookies**: More complex for client-only app
- **sessionStorage**: Lost on tab close
- **No session management**: Poor user experience

## Form Validation

### Decision: Native HTML5 validation + JavaScript enhancement
**Rationale**: Progressive enhancement, accessible by default, fast performance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Validation libraries**: External dependencies
- **JavaScript only**: Less accessible
- **No validation**: Poor user experience

## UI Framework

### Decision: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with CSS Grid/Flexbox
**Rationale**: No dependencies, maximum performance, full control over styling for constitutional compliance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **CSS frameworks**: Larger bundle, less customization
- **JavaScript frameworks**: Complexity overkill for this scope
- **Web Components**: Good but adds complexity

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for integration
**Rationale**: Jest is standard for JavaScript testing. Playwright provides reliable browser automation for integration tests.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Vitest**: Newer but Jest is more established
- **Cypress**: Good but Playwright has better performance
- **Manual testing only**: Not sustainable
