# Tasks: User Authentication & Product Management Webapp

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-an-webapp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: HTML5/CSS3/JS, IndexedDB, Web Crypto API, client-side structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: User and Product entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: AuthService, ProductService, StorageService → service test tasks
   → quickstart.md: User flows → integration test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, HTML pages, CSS framework
   → Tests: service tests, integration tests for user flows
   → Core: authentication service, product service, storage service
   → Integration: UI components, form validation, session management
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, accessibility
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Client-side web application structure:
- **HTML pages**: `src/` root and `src/pages/`
- **Styles**: `src/styles/`
- **JavaScript**: `src/js/`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 [P] Create main HTML file src/index.html with basic structure
- [x] T003 [P] Create authentication pages src/pages/login.html and src/pages/signup.html
- [x] T004 [P] Create product pages src/pages/dashboard.html and src/pages/product-form.html
- [x] T005 [P] Initialize main CSS stylesheet src/styles/main.css
- [x] T006 [P] Create authentication styles src/styles/auth.css
- [x] T007 [P] Create product management styles src/styles/products.css
- [x] T008 Configure Jest testing environment with package.json

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T009 [P] Storage service contract tests in tests/unit/storage.test.js
- [ ] T010 [P] Authentication service contract tests in tests/unit/auth.test.js
- [ ] T011 [P] Product service contract tests in tests/unit/products.test.js
- [ ] T012 [P] User registration integration test in tests/integration/user-flow.test.js
- [ ] T013 [P] User login/logout integration test in tests/integration/user-flow.test.js
- [ ] T014 [P] Product CRUD integration test in tests/integration/crud-flow.test.js
- [ ] T015 [P] Form validation integration test in tests/integration/crud-flow.test.js

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T016 [P] Implement utilities and validation in src/js/utils.js
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement IndexedDB storage service in src/js/storage.js
- [ ] T018 [P] Implement user authentication service in src/js/auth.js
- [ ] T019 [P] Implement product CRUD service in src/js/products.js
- [ ] T020 Implement main application controller in src/js/app.js
- [ ] T021 Connect login form to authentication service
- [ ] T022 Connect signup form to authentication service
- [ ] T023 Connect product dashboard to product service
- [ ] T024 Connect product form to product service

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T025 Implement session management and route protection
- [ ] T026 Add form validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] T027 Implement error handling and user notifications
- [ ] T028 Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] T029 Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] T030 Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T031 [P] Unit tests for validation functions in tests/unit/utils.test.js
- [ ] T032 [P] Performance optimization (<2s page load, <200ms UI response)
- [ ] T033 [P] Accessibility compliance verification (WCAG 2.1)
- [ ] T034 [P] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] T035 [P] Security testing for client-side storage
- [ ] T036 Code cleanup and remove duplication
- [ ] T037 Run complete quickstart validation scenarios

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T008) before everything
- Tests (T009-T015) before implementation (T016-T024)
- Core services (T016-T019) before UI integration (T020-T024)
- Basic implementation before advanced integration (T025-T030)
- Everything before polish (T031-T037)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch setup tasks together:
Task: "Create main HTML file src/index.html with basic structure"
Task: "Create authentication pages src/pages/login.html and src/pages/signup.html"
Task: "Create product pages src/pages/dashboard.html and src/pages/product-form.html"
Task: "Initialize main CSS stylesheet src/styles/main.css"

# Launch service test tasks together:
Task: "Storage service contract tests in tests/unit/storage.test.js"
Task: "Authentication service contract tests in tests/unit/auth.test.js"
Task: "Product service contract tests in tests/unit/products.test.js"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing services
- Test each service independently before integration
- Commit after each completed task
- Focus on client-side security for password hashing and session management

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - auth-service.md → T010 (auth service tests) + T018 (auth service implementation)
   - product-service.md → T011 (product service tests) + T019 (product service implementation)
   - storage-service.md → T009 (storage service tests) + T017 (storage service implementation)
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - User entity → T018 (authentication service implementation)
   - Product entity → T019 (product service implementation)
   - Storage schemas → T017 (storage service implementation)
   
3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - User registration flow → T012 (registration integration test)
   - User login/logout flow → T013 (login/logout integration test)
   - Product CRUD workflow → T014 (CRUD integration test)
   - Form validation testing → T015 (validation integration test)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Services → UI Components → Integration → Polish
   - Services must pass tests before UI integration
   - Session management after authentication service

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T009-T011)
- [x] All entities have service implementations (T017-T019)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T009-T015 before T016-T024)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (marked [P] tasks use different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] User flow scenarios covered in integration tests
- [x] Constitutional requirements addressed (performance, accessibility, security)
