# E-Commerce Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centered Design
Every interface MUST prioritize clean, intuitive design that users can understand immediately. 
UI components must be tested for usability, accessible to all users, and optimized for conversion. 
Design decisions must be validated through user testing and data-driven insights.

### II. Fast Checkout Experience
Checkout flow MUST be streamlined for speed and simplicity. Maximum 3 steps from cart to 
confirmation. Performance targets: <2 seconds page load, <5 seconds total checkout time. 
Remove friction at every step to maximize conversion rates.

### III. Transparent Policies
All policies, pricing, and terms MUST be clearly communicated before user commitment. 
No hidden fees, clear return policies, transparent shipping costs. Trust through clarity 
is non-negotiable. Users must understand exactly what they're buying and paying.

### IV. Test-First Development
All user-facing features MUST have automated tests verifying functionality and usability. 
Critical paths (checkout, payment) require comprehensive integration testing. Tests must 
cover both technical functionality and business logic validation.

### V. Performance & Reliability
System MUST maintain high availability (99.9%+) and fast response times (<200ms API, <2s page loads). 
Monitor user experience metrics, optimize for conversion, ensure scalability for peak traffic. 
Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

## Security Requirements

E-commerce platforms handle sensitive customer data and financial transactions, requiring 
strict security standards. All payment processing must be PCI DSS compliant. Customer data 
must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Regular security audits and penetration testing 
are mandatory. Access controls must follow principle of least privilege.

## Quality Assurance

All changes affecting user experience or business logic must undergo thorough testing. 
This includes automated testing, manual QA verification, and where applicable, A/B testing 
for optimization. Critical features require sign-off from both technical and business stakeholders.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guides all technical decisions. 
Amendments require documentation of impact analysis, stakeholder approval, and migration plan. 
All code reviews and feature proposals must verify constitutional compliance.

Complexity that violates these principles must be explicitly justified with business rationale. 
Performance and user experience are primary concerns that cannot be compromised for 
technical convenience.
